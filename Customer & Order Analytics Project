## In this project, I need to clean the data, filter the NULL's and use codes to get answers.##

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
## length(orderid) = 6 is used to make sure that only the numbers appear, making sure that the letters don't show in the results. orderid <> 'Order ID' is to make
sure that NULLS don't appear in the search results. I use this method in many of the answers.##

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
##For this question, I needed to join both tables into one, making sure that there weren't any NULL's or Order ID writing. I decided to use INNER JOIN##

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id = FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity) * price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT  sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity) * price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
##In order to combine both the customer table and the FebSales table, I used the LEFT JOIN and placed the results to show more than 2 quantities for Feb.## 

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
##For this, I used the % in order to find the products that were sold in Los Angeles. This would include all addresses that include the city Los Angeles.##
## like is used to search for what comes after, making it much easier to get what products were sold in Los Angeles and how many.##
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product
