# In this project, there are databases on many shows that were gathered. There are five questions.

1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT count(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

#ANSWER: 6131 movies.


2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#ANSWER: 2021-09-25


3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
ORDER BY title ASC;

#This causes all the titles to be in alphabetical order, starting from numberals to the letter Z.


4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

# In this one, it would join both tables to pair the director to the title of the movie.

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id= people.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

#ANSWER: Jane Campion


5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
#In order to find the oldest movie, I made sure to limit the amount of results to 1 and have the release_date in ASC order. 


SELECT release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC LIMIT 1;

#ANSWER: 1945
