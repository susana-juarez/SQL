In this project, there is information on the top 50 songs playing on Spotify. These are some of the questions that I came up with and the answers in SQL.

#1. What are the top 5 tracks with the most popularity?
**Here I wanted to show the song, artist and the highest rating in popularity.**

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 50
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5

#2. What is the average duration of the songs?
**For questions 2 & 3, I wanted to know the average of the duration_ms of the song and the average of the popularity of a song.**

SELECT id, AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata


#3. What is the average popularity?

SELECT id, AVG(popularity), popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata


#4. Which 5 songs have the least popularity?
 
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity <= 80
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5 
 

#5.
